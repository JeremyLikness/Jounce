# Unit Testing

Jounce doesn't impose any specific requirements for your unit tests - in other words, there is nothing "special" about how the framework functions that would drive your unit tests to work differently. If anything, the decoupling of the views and viewmodels should work in favor of unit tests.

I've written quite a bit about unit testing Silverlight, including XAML and view models, so here are a few articles to help you:
