**Project Description**
Jounce is a framework for Silverlight intended to provide basic building bocks for modular line of business applications that follow the MVVM pattern and utilize the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF).

Jounce is inspired by existing frameworks you are encouraged to explore, including [Prism](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/) and [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/). Jounce specifically provides MVVM components using MEF and is based on the authors' experience building enterprise line of business modular Silverlight applications. 

Watch the [Getting Started](http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2012/01/video-getting-started-with-jounce-mvvm.html) video.
