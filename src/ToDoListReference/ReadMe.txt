This solution contains the "To Do List" reference application that is described in detail in the book: 

Likness, Jeremy. Designing Silverlight Business Applications: Best Practices for Using Silverlight Effectively in the Enterprise. 
1st ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley Professional, 2012. Print. Microsoft .NET Development Ser.

The example is intended to demonstrate several different features that are common in enterprise applications.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive solution nor to provide production-ready components. It is simply guidance for
a series of areas to show how various technologies can integrate into an end solution. There were certainly short cuts
taken and places where the structure/architecture could be improved. Much of this is discussed in the book and therefore
is not repeated here. 

Specifically, this solution demonstrates the following:

* Jounce framework (http://jounce.codeplex.com/) 
* MVVM pattern
* Shared view models that display non-shared data 
* Jounce navigation and parameter passing
* Visual State Manager (VSM)
* Design-time support
* Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)
* RIA Services 
* Mapping
* Event aggregator messaging
* Repository pattern
* Sterling (object-oriented) database (http://sterling.codeplex.com/) 
* Synchronization between client and server databases 
* Concurrency management 
* Offline/OOB mode including install and remove
* Use of behaviors 
* Extensions for fluent programming 
* Region management
* Validation 
* Printing 
* Localization (defaulted to an edit form with some Spanish resources) 
* Interop (export to Excel) 
* HTML DOM interaction (i.e. JavaScript intercept of save)
* Dirty tracking (i.e. record updates) 
* Filtering and sorting 
* Touch integration (via the Wintellect LightTouch library, http://lighttouch.codeplex.com/)
* OOB child windows 
* Toast notifications
* Testing 

Please do not post questions about this example to the discussion forums or the author unless you
have already read the book. The book spends several chapters diving deep into the rationale and
construction of this example, and answers many questions. If you've taken advantage of that resource
and still have questions, feel free to reach out on the Jounce discussion forums at:
